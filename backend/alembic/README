Alembic configuration for the RÃ©alisons backend.

## Usage

1. Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set or configure the
   standard `DB_*` variables consumed by `app.database`.
2. Generate new migrations as the models evolve:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
   ```

3. Apply the migrations to your target database:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

The Alembic environment is wired to the SQLAlchemy models under
`backend/app/models.py`, enabling autogeneration of migration scripts.
